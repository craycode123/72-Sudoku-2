<div><p>Starting with your attempt from the previous iteration of the Sudoku solver, we now want to add the ability to make guessing.</p>
<p>What happens if a square/cell can contain multiple possible numbers and you don’t have enough information to conclude right then and there which number it is?</p>
<p>Most people who play Sudoku do “guessing”. Usually this is done by writing possibilities in the corners of the square.</p>
  <h3>Task: Implement a guessing-friendly version of Sudoku</h3>
  <p>Once we’ve filled in all cells which have only one possible value, we have to guess. Write out a pseudocode for how that might work before you dive in!</p>
  <p>This solver should now be able to solve any Sudoku puzzle, although some will take a long time. Try it with the <code class="inline">sample_unsolved.txt</code> file.</p>
